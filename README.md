 In this HTML/CSS code I have created a front-end UI using HTML/CSS and the help of bootstrap 3.

The icons such as "Sign UP" are taken from https://fontawesome.com/

The background image has been taken from https://unsplash.com/

Both sites can help you for kickstarting a good basic images and icons for yoour UI.

This file is good for getting started using html/css for front-end. 

The file includes the HTML named as "Index.html" as well as the css file named as "app.css".

Just clone the git repository in your computer and run it on any of your prefered browser. HTML will automatically detect the css file and run in parallel whenever necesary.
